            <p>
                As the New Brunswick High Schools’ Racialized Students Alliance, we wish to acknowledge the unceded
                territory
                of the Welastekwiyik (Maliseet), Mi’kmaq, and Passamaquoddy peoples. For many years, it has been the
                traditional
                land of Indigenous peoples. To this day, it is still the home to many Indigenous peoples across New
                Brunswick,
                and we appreciate the opportunity to live, work, and learn on this land. We are committed to supporting
                Indigenous-led initiatives and furthering our understanding of Indigenous history and culture.

                <p>
                    We envision a New Brunswick where high school students of every background feel empowered to lead,
                    confident in their voices, and fully represented in the decisions that shape their lives.
                    A province where diversity isn’t just acknowledged, but embraced as essential to a just and thriving
                    school culture.

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to center and elevate the lived experiences of racialized students by fostering
                    inclusive
                    leadership, creating safe spaces for dialogue and support, and driving systemic change through
                    youth-led action.
                    We believe in the power of community, collaboration, and courageous conversations to build a better
                    future—starting in our schools.
