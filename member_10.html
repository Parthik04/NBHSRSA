      <p><strong>About:</strong> Chairing a province-wide student alliance is never just a title—it is a
        responsibility I carry with purpose. I, Suzanne Shah, am one of the founders and the Chair of the New
        Brunswick High School Racialized Student Alliance. Together, we lead a collective committed to amplifying
        the voices of racialized students across the province.</p>

      <p>I oversee the direction of our work, facilitate meaningful conversations, and support student-led
        initiatives that challenge systemic inequities and center lived experiences.</p>

      <p>Born and raised in India, I bring a deep understanding of cultural complexity, resilience, and the power
        of representation. This journey fuels my passion for advocacy and storytelling. I believe in journalism
        that doesn’t just report the news, but makes space for the unseen and unheard.</p>

      <p>Currently in my third year at St. Thomas University, I study Journalism, Communications, and Digital
        Media—not just as academic subjects, but as tools for change and connection. My goal is to become the
        world’s first hijabi journalist at CBC, and someday, BBC. I am here to tell stories that matter—and to make
        sure the world listens.</p>
