    <div class="about-card">
      <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Zayed El Aaidy, and I am a Grade 12 student at Moncton High School. I currently serve as the Vice President of the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA) where I work to build an environment that includes and supports all high school students, regardless of their language, ethnicity, or background.</p>

      <p>Born and raised in the United Arab Emirates and proud of my Moroccan roots, I grew up in a country where people from all over the world lived and worked together. Seeing that cultural unity molded my belief that unity is the cornerstone of a thriving society, and I am passionate about creating that exact sense of unity by using my voice to advocate for cultural representation and equity.</p>

      <p>Through my involvement in the student council, I’ve gained firsthand experience in leadership, teamwork, and the dedication it takes to plan events. I also learned what it means to represent fellow students, manage responsibilities under pressure, and turn ideas into meaningful actions. That’s why the quote: <em>“With great power, comes great responsibility.”</em> is so important to me.</p>

      <p>I joined NBHS-RSA to challenge the systems that prevent racialized students from reaching their full potential. Listening to their stories has deepened my resolve for advocacy. As Vice President, I use my leadership to promote cultural representation and raise awareness of the unique mental health challenges faced by racialized youth. I support our team and work closely with the President to help bring our vision to life.</p>

      <p>Outside of the Alliance, I enjoy meeting new people and joining fun events and activities. In my free time, you’ll often find me hanging out with friends—usually on some random side quest.</p>
