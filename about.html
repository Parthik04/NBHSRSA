      <p><strong>Who We Are:</strong><br>
        We are the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA)—a youth-led, student-powered
        alliance that brings together racialized high school students across New Brunswick to lead, connect, and create
        change.

      <p><strong>What We Do:</strong><br>
        We amplify underrepresented voices, advocate for equity in education, and build inclusive leadership
        opportunities. Through campaigns and student-led events, we create a strong and supportive community that stands
        for justice and belonging.

      <p><strong>Why We Exist:</strong><br>
        Because every student deserves to be heard, represented, and empowered. We believe that when racialized students
        lead, schools become more just, more vibrant, and more reflective of the world we want to build—together.

      <p><strong>Our Identity:</strong><br>
        The NBHS-RSA is a student-led alliance united by a shared purpose: to uplift the voices and experiences of
        racialized high school students across the province. We are a space where identity is celebrated, leadership is
        cultivated, and change is driven by those most affected.

      <p><strong>Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI):</strong><br>
        At NBHSRSA, we are committed to fostering a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for all students across
        New Brunswick. We recognize the importance of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in building stronger
        schools and communities, and we strive to reflect these values in all of our work.

        Our mission includes supporting new and current immigrants by creating safe spaces where they feel seen,
        respected, and heard. We advocate for language inclusion, ensuring that both French and Indigenous languages, as
        well as the diverse languages spoken by immigrant communities, are embraced and represented in schools. By
        celebrating cultural differences and promoting inclusive education, we aim to ensure every student in New
        Brunswick has the opportunity to thrive.

        NBHSRSA stands firmly in our commitment to DEI, and we continue working toward a future where all students
        regardless of background are empowered, included, and valued.

      <p><strong>200 Word Blog:</strong><br>
        At the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA), our ambition is bold, clear, and
        deeply rooted in the belief that youth-led change can transform our schools, and our future. We envision a
        province where every racialized student feels empowered to lead, confident in their identity, and fully
        represented in decisions that shape their educational experience.
        Looking ahead, our goal is to build a stronger, louder, and more united community of racialized youth across New
        Brunswick. We plan to have a series of advocacy events, including a virtual NBHSRSA event, to connect students
        from all corners of the province. Our future also includes student led conferences, impactful campaigns, and
        online initiatives that amplify voices and stories which are often overlooked.

        Our mission is to amplify the voices of racialized students, foster inclusive leadership, and create spaces
        where diversity is not only acknowledged but celebrated. Through student-led campaigns, advocacy posts, and
        collaborative initiatives, we are working to ensure that schools across New Brunswick become more just, vibrant,
        and reflective of the communities they serve.

        We’re here to represent. We’re here to lead. And we’re here to stay. The future we want begins with the
        voices of today.
