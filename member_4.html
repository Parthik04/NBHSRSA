      <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Arvel John Arellano, and I’m entering my final year at Moncton High School. I currently serve as the Media and Tech Coordinator for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA), where I merge creativity, communication, and advocacy to help elevate voices that deserve to be heard.</p>

      <p>With roots from the Philippines, I’ve grown up with a deep appreciation for cultural identity, diversity, and the need for authentic representation. Through my role, I contribute to our digital outreach, manage media content, and support the technical side of our campaigns and events. My focus is on using storytelling and design to foster connection, spark awareness, and bring visibility to the challenges and experiences faced by racialized youth.</p>

      <p>Within NBHS-RSA, I assist with communication strategies, event promotion, and internal coordination to keep our initiatives engaging and impactful. I believe media has the power to not only reflect the world as it is—but to imagine what it can be.</p>

      <p>Outside of the Alliance, I enjoy being involved in the STEM club, participating in school events, and being part of projects that celebrate culture, collaboration, and student voice. I’m committed to helping build a more inclusive and united future, where every student has the space to thrive and be recognized for who they are.</p>
