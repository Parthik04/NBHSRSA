        <p><strong>About:</strong> As the democratically elected president for the Alliance, I'm eager to spread my
            bubbles of leadership and lead with passion and love. I'm Sama, a student at Fredericton High School, and
            I'm keen to leverage my skills for the betterment of the Alliance and our initiatives. Growing up away from
            my homeland, Egypt, I struggled with my cultural identity and often felt a deep, aching longing for
            connectionâ€”like pieces of my puzzle were missing.
            At 15, I became globally conscious and was saddened, horrified, and discouraged to witness crimes committed
            against humanity. The dire situation in Palestine, among many other places globally, truly opened my eyes.
            From that point on, I was determined to dedicate my time to advocating, demonstrating, and shining a light
            on the various humanitarian catastrophes worldwide. My devotion and passion for human rights have grown
            incredibly, empowering me to highlight the importance of cultural diversity and equity within the school
            setting and to advocate and fundraise for noble causes.
            This deep commitment is greatly supported by my continuous journey of leadership. From co-founding FHS's
            first social action cultural club, Arabian Roots, to actively shaping community events through volunteer
            work, I have consistently sought to make a great difference. I even took the journey to co-found a youth-led
            non-profit, Young ChangeMakers, passionately empowering young people to become civic leaders in their own
            communities. These experiences have not only shaped my skills but also solidified my commitment to giving
            back. Now, as president of the Alliance, I'm ready to leverage this foundation to lead with purpose and
            expand our collective impact. My goal is to ensure every voice is heard, every idea is valued, and every
            member feels equipped to contribute to our shared vision and initiatives.
