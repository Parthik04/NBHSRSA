      <p><strong>About:</strong> As the democratically elected president for the Alliance, I'm eager to spread my
        bubbles of leadership and lead with passion and love. I'm Sama, a student at Fredericton High School, and
        I'm keen to leverage my skills for the betterment of the Alliance and our initiatives.</p>

      <p>Growing up away from my homeland, Egypt, I struggled with my cultural identity and often felt a deep,
        aching longing for connectionâ€”like pieces of my puzzle were missing. At 15, I became globally conscious and
        was saddened, horrified, and discouraged to witness crimes committed against humanity.</p>

      <p>The dire situation in Palestine, among many other places globally, truly opened my eyes. From that point
        on, I was determined to dedicate my time to advocating, demonstrating, and shining a light on the various
        humanitarian catastrophes worldwide.</p>

      <p>My devotion and passion for human rights have grown incredibly, empowering me to highlight the importance
        of cultural diversity and equity within the school setting and to advocate and fundraise for noble causes.</p>

      <p>This deep commitment is greatly supported by my continuous journey of leadership. From co-founding FHS's
        first social action cultural club, Arabian Roots, to actively shaping community events through volunteer
        work, I have consistently sought to make a great difference.</p>

      <p>I even took the journey to co-found a youth-led non-profit, <em>Young ChangeMakers</em>, passionately
        empowering young people to become civic leaders in their own communities. These experiences have not only
        shaped my skills but also solidified my commitment to giving back.</p>

      <p>Now, as president of the Alliance, I'm ready to leverage this foundation to lead with purpose and expand
        our collective impact. My goal is to ensure every voice is heard, every idea is valued, and every member
        feels equipped to contribute to our shared vision and initiatives.</p>
