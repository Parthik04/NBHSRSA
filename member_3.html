      <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Jordanne Dyke, and I’m a Grade 11 student at Moncton High School. I recently moved to Canada from Jamaica, and I’m proud to be the Treasurer for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA).</p>

      <p>I joined the Alliance because I care about making sure racialized students feel seen, heard, and supported in their schools. I’m passionate about culturally inclusive and respectful education, and about standing up against discrimination in all forms. I hope to help connect racialized students across the province and build a stronger sense of community and belonging.</p>

      <p>In my role, I will help with managing the finances and keeping things organized so that our team can focus on making a real impact. I like being someone my team can count on, and I’m always looking for ways to grow.</p>

      <p>Outside of NBHS-RSA, I love drawing, playing music with the viola, and getting involved in sports. Even if I’m not the most athletic, I enjoy trying new things—whether it’s volleyball or something I’ve never done before, I’m always up for a challenge.</p>

      <p>To me, leadership is about supporting others, staying true to your values, and helping create spaces where everyone feels like they belong.</p>
