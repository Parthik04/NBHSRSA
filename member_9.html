      <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is K’áe Kargegie, and my name means “Willow” in Dene Kede—my Indigenous language. This is deeply personal to me, as Willow is also my mother’s name and she’s the most influential person in my life. I am from Inuvik and Délįnę, Northwest Territories, and moved to New Brunswick about a year and a half ago. Coming from a mostly Indigenous community to a place where that presence is less visible has shown me just how vital Indigenous voices are.</p>

      <p>As an Indigenous woman of Inuit and Dene heritage, I am honoured to serve as the Indigenous Students Executive Representative for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA). This role is incredibly meaningful to me because I’ve always felt called to advocate for my people. One example was my speech at the NWT Youth Parliament, where I addressed issues like alcoholism and drug abuse—some of the most painful and visible legacies of residential schools.</p>

      <p>Three of my grandparents were residential school survivors, and I grew up witnessing the intergenerational trauma these systems caused. Our communities continue to bear these scars, and I feel a deep responsibility to speak out and lead. Through NBHS-RSA, I hope to raise awareness about Indigenous history, advocate for Indigenous students across New Brunswick, and carry forward the voices of my home community.</p>

      <p>I’m excited to bring an indigenized perspective to our work and help build a future where Indigenous youth are respected, empowered, and celebrated for who we are.</p>
