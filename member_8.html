      <p><strong>About:</strong> My name is Kamsiyochukwu Nelly Enwelumibeanu, mostly known as Nelly.E, and I am the Diversity and Inclusion Officer for the New Brunswick High Schools Racialized Student Alliance (NBHS-RSA). I am a Grade 11 student at Harrison Trimble High School. In my role, I use my voice and leadership to advocate for racialized youth and promote inclusion and diversity across all schools in New Brunswick. I’ve served on various youth advisory committees, including the District, Moncton, and Pure Gold youth advisory teams.</p>

      <p>I’m deeply committed to being a representative for my peers—especially those who look like me. I have a strong passion for eradicating racism and its barriers, and I proudly embrace and celebrate my Nigerian and Igbo cultural heritage. Through NBHS-RSA, I aim to organize school-wide events that bring students of all backgrounds together, foster dialogue around real issues, and create safe, empowering spaces for everyone.</p>

      <p>Beyond the Alliance, I’m part of my school’s track and field team, hold a part-time job, and actively participate in multiple youth advisory committees. I’m also a proud member of a Nigerian dance club that performs regularly during the summer. I love spending time with friends, traveling, cooking, sewing, and always searching for ways to grow personally while giving back to my community—all while being an honours student.</p>
